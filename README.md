# What is Rexact

Rexact is a [lightweight](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=rexact) **state management library** for React applications based on [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) pattern.

# Installation

This assumes that youâ€™re using npm or yarn with a module bundler like webpack

## NPM

```
npm install rexact --save
```

## Yarn

```
yarn add rexact
```

Then you can directly import rexact componets:

```javascript
import { Store } from 'rexact'
```

# Getting Started

## The simplest Store

First, create your store configuration. It is pretty straightforward, just provide an initial state object, and some mutations. Then pass the store configuration to rexact Store component.

```javascript
// App.js
import { Store } from 'rexact'
import Counter from './Counter'

const config = {
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++
    },
    decrement(state) {
      state.count--
    }
  }
}

const App = () => (
  <div className="App">
    <Store config={config}>
      <Counter />
    </Store>
  </div>
)
```

Now you can use the _withStore_ hight order component to acces the store

```javascript
// Counter.js
import React from 'react'
import { withStore } from 'rexact'

const counter = ({ store }) => (
  <div className="counter">
    <button onClick={() => store.commit('increment')}>+</button>
    <p>{store.state.count}</p>
    <button onClick={() => store.commit('decrement')}>-</button>
  </div>
)

export const Counter = withStore(counter)
```

# Core Concepts

## State

Rexact uses a **Single state tree** - that is, this single object contains all your application level state and serves as the "single source of truth".

Lets create a very siple store with a counter state:

```javascript
const config = {
  state: { count: 0 }
}
const Counter = withStore(({ store }) => <div>{store.state.count}</div>)
const App = () => (
  <Store config={config}>
    <Counter />
  </Store>
)
```

Whenever store.state.count changes, it will automatically update the Counter component.

## Getters

Sometimes we may need to compute derived state based on store state, for example filtering through a list of items and counting them:

```javascript
const Todos = ({ store }) => {
  const doneTodosCount = store.state.todosfilter(todo => todo.done).length
  return <div>Done todos: {doneTodosCount}</div>
}
```

If more than one component needs to make use of this, we have to either duplicate the function, or extract it into a shared helper and import it in multiple places - both are less than ideal.

Rexact allows us to define "getters" in the store, so we can easily reuse these functions.

Getters will receive the state as their 1st argument:

```javascript
// Store config
const config = {
  state: {
    todos: [
      { id: 1, text: '...', done: true },
      { id: 2, text: '...', done: false }
    ]
  },
  getters: {
    doneTodos: state => {
      return state.todos.filter(todo => todo.done)
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// Todos.js
const Todos = ({ store }) => (
  <div>Done todos: {store.getters.doneTodosCount}</div>
)
```

## Mutations

The only way to actually change state in a Rexact store is by committing a mutation. Rexact mutations are very similar to events: each mutation has a string type and a handler. The handler function is where we perform actual state modifications, and it will receive the state as the first argument:

```javascript
const config = {
  state: {
    count: 1
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      // mutate state
      state.count++
    }
  }
}
```

You cannot directly call a mutation handler. Think of it more like event registration: "When a mutation with type increment is triggered, call this handler." To invoke a mutation handler, you need to call store.commit with its type:

```javascript
const Counter = ({ store }) => (
  <div>
    <button onClick={() => store.commit('increment')} />+</button>
    <p>{store.state.count}</p>
  </div>
)
```

### Commit with Payload

You can pass an additional argument to store.commit, which is called the payload for the mutation:

```javascript
mutations: {
  increment (state, n) {
    state.count += n
  }
}
```

```javascript
store.commit('increment', 10)
```

### Object-Style Commit

An alternative way to commit a mutation is by directly using an object that has a type property:

```javascript
store.commit({
  type: 'increment',
  amount: 10
})
```

When using object-style commit, the entire object will be passed as the payload to mutation handlers, so the handler remains the same:

```javascript
mutations: {
  increment (state, payload) {
    state.count += payload.amount
  }
}
```

## Actions

Actions are similar to mutations, the differences being that:

- Instead of mutating the state, actions commit mutations.
- Actions can contain arbitrary asynchronous operations.

```javascript
config = {
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++
    }
  },
  actions: {
    increment(context) {
      context.commit('increment')
    }
  }
}
```

Action handlers receive a context object which exposes the same set of methods/properties on the store instance, so you can call context.commit to commit a mutation, or access the state and getters via context.state and context.getters. We can even call other actions with context.dispatch

```javascript
actions: {
  increment ({ commit }) {
    commit('increment')
  }
}
```

### Dispatching Actions

Actions are triggered with the store.dispatch method:

```javascript
store.dispatch('increment')
```
